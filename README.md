# Overview
Detecting forests in satellite images becomes accessible with this Python prototype, employing the prowess of OpenCV and computer vision techniques. This project automates the identification of forested regions, holding great potential for environmental analysis, land management, and ecological studies.

This project unites the capabilities of Python, OpenCV, and machine learning to automate forest detection in satellite images. By integrating image preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, classification, and visualization, the result is a system that contributes to environmental analysis and monitoring.
